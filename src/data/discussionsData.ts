For example, if you store StudentName and DepartmentHod in the same table, you duplicate the HOD name for every student in that department. By splitting into a Students table and a Departments table, the HOD name is stored exactly once, eliminating storage redundancy and preventing insertion anomalies.',

Fibonacci heaps have very high constant factors. For Dijkstra, using a binary heap yields O((V+E) log V) which runs in milliseconds. Fibonacci heap\'s theoretical O(E + V log V) only beats it on extremely dense, gigantic graphs.',
